# linear-regression-project-spg

The project aimed to analyse the impact of the mobile app experience and the website on the e-commerce company's sales.
The linear regression model achieved the following evaluation metrics:  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 7.228148653430823,Mean Squared Error (MSE): 79.8130516509741,Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 8.933815066978614
The coefficient analysis revealed that an increase in the average session length was associated with a $25.98 increase in total dollars spent.
Additionally, the analysis showed that a 1 unit increase in time spent on the app resulted in a $38.59 increase in total dollars spent, while a 1 unit increase in time spent on the website led to a $0.19 increase in total dollars spent. Furthermore, a 1 unit increase in the length of membership was associated with a $61.27 increase in total dollars spent.
